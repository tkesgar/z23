# You should try Bun

Bun 1.0 has been out for a few months, and from our experience it mostly work well. We have created an internal service using Nuxt 3 on Bun and it works normally. We also have created an Express-based internal tool based on Bun and it mostly works well, save for some edge cases involving async response handler (I will try to create a reproduction later). We have not checked the service performance and resource usage, but from some testing it seems Bun can serve HTTP plain text responses faster than HTTP binary responses (e.g. images, videos).

While Bun advertises Node.js compatibility, there are still some tools that does not work on Bun, such as Vitest; `bun test` is a good replacement but it is only available in Bun.

I would not recommend you to fully switching to Bun and migrating your existing applications or tools to Bun; after all, Bun is only 6 months old while Node.js has been avaiable since around 2018 (5 years). However, you should try using Bun for building new internal apps or tools. You will enjoy much faster overall experience such as faster package installation and test run.

## Idea: Node.js compatibility test suite

Node.js is still by far the de facto JS runtime, and some runtimes such as Bun and Deno provide some compatibility with Node.js standard libraries and modules. I think it would be helpful if someone made a Node.js compatibility test suite so runtime maintainers can find out some possible edge cases.
